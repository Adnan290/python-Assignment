    "Q1)Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",

    "object oriented programming is the type model in which programs are organized around data, and to form the task with respect to the different classes like car,shoping mall, cloths etc.. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2)List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Reduced cognitive load (have less to think about and more natural paradigm)\n",
    "2-Isolation of programmers (better team programming)\n",
    "3-Less propagation of errors more adaptable/flexible programs\n",
    "4-Faster development due to reuse of code\n",

    "Q3)Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Function:\n",
    "A program that provides some functionality can be long and contains many statements\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "A method groups a sequence of statements and shouldprovide a well-defined, easy-to-understand functionality\n",

    "1.Class:\n",
    "In programming: a pattern, blueprint, or template for modeling real world objects which have similar attributes.\n",
    "2.Object:\n",
    "Objects are the basic run-time entities of an object orientedsystem.\n",
    "They may represent a person, a place or any item that the program must handle.\n",
    "3.Attribute:\n",
    "A given set of data which describes the object.\n",
